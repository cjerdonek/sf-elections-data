# SF Elections Data

[SF Elections Data][sf_elections_data] is a project to expand the amount
of open data and open source tools to work with San Francisco elections.

Current projects include--

* [SF Base Election Data (SFBED).][SFBED] A JSON file that captures the
  information about San Francisco elections that tends to remain the
  same from election to election.
* [WinEDS Converter.][WinEDS] A tool to make San Francisco precinct-level
  vote totals available in an easy-to-parse TSV format.
* [OpenRCV.][OpenRCV] A tool to tabulate the results of ranked choice
  voting elections like those conducted in San Francisco.  This is
  also a Knight News Challenge [submission][knight_submission].

SF Elections Data is a project of [Code for San Francisco][code_for_sf].
