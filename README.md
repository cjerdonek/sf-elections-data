# SF Elections Data

[SF Elections Data][sf_elections_data] is a project to turn more information
about San Francisco elections into open data.

We also build tools to create and work with that data.

Current projects include--

* [**SF Base Election Data (SFBED).**][SFBED] A JSON file that captures
  information about San Francisco elections that tends to remain the
  same from election to election.
* [**WinEDS Converter.**][WinEDS] A tool to make San Francisco precinct-level
  vote totals available in an easy-to-parse TSV format.
* [**OpenRCV.**][OpenRCV] A tool to tabulate the results of ranked choice
  voting elections like those conducted in San Francisco.

SF Elections Data is a project of [Code for San Francisco][code_for_sf].
